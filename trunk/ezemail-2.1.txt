EZemail - ver. 2.1

Website:
http://ezemail.sourceforge.net
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezemail/

Added to the subversion repository 3/11/07

Description:
EZemail is a small email program that demonstrates some of Perl's TK/SMTP/POP/MIME capabilities. If you find it useful, helpful or improve it let me know by testing it out and sending me an email (doesn't get any easier than that!).  Send it to: ikepgh@yahoo.com

--ikepgh - 12/17/04 
 
Usage Notes:
Settings are now handled by a config file!  Note:  Your username and password are not encrypted so only use on machines that you are sure are secure... i.e., your own computer, secure network, intranet, etc.  

Windows Notes:  
Not necessary, but you can create a shortcut to a .bat file and then set the shortcut properties to use the .ico file.  You now have a nice icon to start the program from your desktop instead of DOS!  By doing this, you can then set the properties of the shortcut to run the DOS window "minimized" so that it won't pop up each time the program is run. Don't forget to point the shortcut at the ezemail.pl script (also in the shortcut's properties).  An example .bat and the .ico file are included in this archive to get you started. 
 
Requires: 
Perl, TK, LibNet Package (Specifically, Net::SMTP and Net::POP3) and now, MIME::Lite
 
Tested:
EZemail was built with Active State's Perl 5.8.4 Build 810 for Win XP, It has not been thoroughly tested on other platforms yet, but I'd be keen to hear about it.
Also Tested On: Perl 5.6.1 Build 629 for Win 98
